# miCro
C Style code in Agda

Currently, the Interpreter folder holds the interpreter, parser, and tokenizer for actually executing miCro code.

Finished tests are in the Tests folder; if changes are made to the interpreter these may need to be re-run. They will have to be moved into the main directory, since apparently agda can't search folders above it, only below? Or I just can't figure it out

Current test/proof code remains in the main directory to import the Interpreter folder files until they are functional.
